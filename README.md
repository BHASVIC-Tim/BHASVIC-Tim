# About Me

## Who I am
I'm Tim Little, and I teach A level Computer Science at [BHASVIC](https://www.bhasvic.ac.uk/) (Brighton, Hove and Sussex VI form college) which is a big (almost 4,000 students) college for years 12 and 13 (US grades 11 and 12) so 17 and 18 year olds on the south coast of England, almost due south of London.

## What I teach
Languages wise I mostly teach good old fashioned C and Java. I also teach a smidgeon of SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Obviously I also teach topics such as Boolean logic, number reprresentation, data structures and algorithms

## My history

## My repositories
For fun I dabble with the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) each year, sometimes in C and sometimes in Java
