# About Me

## Who I am
I'm Tim Little, and I teach A level Computer Science at [BHASVIC](https://www.bhasvic.ac.uk/) (Brighton, Hove and Sussex VI form college) which is a big (almost 4,000 students) college for years 12 and 13 (US grades 11 and 12) so 17 and 18 year olds on the south coast of England, about 50 miles almost due south of London.

I've been teaching since 2010, mostly on the South Coast, but I also taught in [Mexico](https://edron.edu.mx/) for 5 years. Before that I was a senior analyst/programmer, mostly in FinTech.

## What I teach
Languages wise I mostly teach good old fashioned C and Java. I also teach a smidgeon of SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Obviously I also teach topics such as Boolean logic, number reprresentation, data structures and algorithms

## My repositories
For fun I dabble with the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) each year, sometimes in C and sometimes in Java
- [2023](https://github.com/BHASVIC-Tim/AdventOfCode2023) In C
- 

[Python Data analysis/visualisation](https://github.com/BHASVIC-Tim/PythonProjects/tree/main/example1) - Reads development data from CSV files, cleans and combines and then generates PNG files. e.g. 
![2010 life expectancy vs GDP per head](https://github.com/BHASVIC-Tim/PythonProjects/blob/main/example1/life-expectancy-2010.png)

## My personal GitHub
[timjlittle](https://github.com/timjlittle) has a couple of things I have been playing around with for a while:  

- [Diplomacy](https://github.com/timjlittle)
- -A rules engine for the boardgame Diplomacy implemented in Java, Swing and SQLite. I would like to replace SQLite with JSon
- [Timetable]
